Retargeting is basically a process of tagging website visitors so  you can target them specifically with ads tailored to their level of interest in your company.

Retargeting allows you to segment website visitors into groups and use ad copy and images to appeal to them based on what they did on your site before.

1. Increasing your marketing reach.

Retargeting expands your reach. You will get onto even more websites, exposing people to your brand and your website in new places. It results also in higher brand recall.

Retargeting will also lower substantially spending on advertising because your ads are shown only to a small targeted group of prospective or current customers

2. Greater Engagement.
 

As retargeting allows you to reconnect in a meaningful way with visitors of your website you can tailor retargeting ad to your users need.

3. Increasing Brand Awareness.

There is higher chance for customers to share your ad on their social media channels if ad matches their interest. Customers who visited your site will more easily recall your brand when seeing a banner ad. Retargeting enables your company to set itself apart from the competition

4. Increased Conversion

According to Forrester report 96% of visitors never convert to lead or sale.

Someone who viewed your product already is more likely to buy it. In other words you are more precise in your targeting.

With retargeting you can also feature other of your products or services that visitors might not have found  while visiting your site.

Delivering custom content to visitors who visited specific pages on your site. Providing additional information about products or services to these visitors will increase conversion rates.
