The media agency OMD in partnership with Omnicom creative agency network DDB and clear Channel have launched an outdoor campaign “Share the Road”. The main objective of the campaign is to raise motorists and cyclists awareness of the road safety. To do that they have located 35 media sites with minimalist posters in the main areas of the city.
Great Initiative!
I live in Singapore, small island whose inhabitants seem to be completely tech savvy. Due to the high fees one needs to pay to be allowed to drive and own a car, the number of cars has decreased significantly in the past 5 years. However, the road safety is still a big problem. I was deeply shocked at the very beginning of my stay in Asia, seeing how the drivers behave on the street. I don’t mean keeping the rules but the courtesy which drivers in Singapore lack.

Agencies could do better work.
1. People don’t like being told what to do.

Singapore is famous for being the land of dos and don’s and various prohibitions. But the human mentality all over the world is similar. The minimalist poster with insensible word inscription is not enough. How many people have actually looked at the poster on the street?

2. The campaign needs to be novel.

We remember things which are either shocking or include some emotions.

Posters on the street are nothing new. They look rather like a list of rules or codex.

3. Some element of the public involvement is an absolute must.

People like getting involved in the conversation. Where they can share their ideas and opinions. This is the core of the power of the social media. Putting the few posters on the street is not enough. The truth is that these posters are just like another ads which we tend to ignore.

4. Posters are boring and too schematic.

It might be that the main idea of the artist was to simplify the picture in order to make viewers focus on the main message.  Does it really work? I seriously doubt it. Personally, I don’t find them catching and they wouldn’t bring my personal attention.

To conclude, Effective turn the message people need to listen to into  the message people wan to hear and would love to share. Singaporean agencies didn’t even try to be more creative. It is a pity since there is so much potential which has been simply unused.


     
Spending most of their free time on surfing the net, Singaporeans are digitally savvy. With various social media at hand, could have used these tools as an effective way to get the message across.

In November 2012 an Australian agency working for the Metro Trains in Melbourne proved that a campaign with a message doesn’t need to be boring. “Dumb ways to die “ campaign”,  that have used a song with the element of the black humour, is the perfect example. Within a few weeks it became viral. The agency has also published karaoke version of the famous song and encouraged viewers to make their own interpretations. Here you can find the video of the “Dumb Ways to Die”.
