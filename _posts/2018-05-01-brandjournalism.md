Since  the current marketing concept  bases on the content,  many companies  have already started thinking like journalists when creating  stories about the brand.

The main idea of the new approach, which is brand journalism is to tell  engaging stories.

They can be about industry leaders, trends, or events  – anything that would be deemed newsworthy for audience, in the editorial sense.  

 

Brand journalism as a new profession has entered the marketing world few years ago when social media .

Is traditional media going to be replaced by brand journalism?

To answer this question we need to come back to the issue of why do we  media so appealing.

On blogs  we look for some kind of reality, subjective opinion of the average consumer who is sharing our problems.

We read newspapers because of meaningful  and impartial content they present. We trust them due to  their tradition, faithfulness to  journalistic standards, where  the particular view on the matter must be based on facts and selective data.

Brand journalism  focuses on one brand only. Even if  texts cover general information  about the latest  industry trends, the full impartiality cannot be achieved.

Brand journalism cannot pretend to be real journalism, since the  average consumer will be able to distinguish between the two.

However, it doesn’t mean that brand journalism won’t get any attention. Well written brand story can be also engaging and there is no doubt that there is place for it on the market.  What is your opinion? Do you think that brand journalism can replace traditional journalism or maybe only traditional PR?
