It is widely known, that the main concern of the scientists is to publish in the top journals as many papers as possible and get funding for the further research. They simply don’t care about the things like marketing  and believe that it is the tool reserved mainly for the companies. In their opinion promising experiment results are enough to pursue the career in science.

Corporate world  views the problem in the different way. Larry Page  once said that scientist should spend part of their budget on the marketing. There may be the best products one creates in the lab, but without marketing it becomes a failure if no one knows about it. It is no coincidence that even the best scientific ideas which could be launched onto the market are ignored by the biggest companies.

How  can media  help you to achieve your goals?

1.   Publishing papers.

Good contacts is the key to success in the todays world. Getting your paper published in the top journal can change your career but it is not an easy thing to do.

How many times has it happened to  you that your professor has submitted very promising paper in the one of the top journals but the paper was rejected? The truth is that due to the  high competition only the few people have the chance to get their paper published in the top journals. Editors tend to reject the papers which  results are  competing with the  work  done in their own labs. The best solution to the problem is to make collaboration with somebody renowned for the work in their field and  make good contacts. With no doubts, social media marketing can help you  with achieving this aim.

2.  Getting collaborators

Networking can help you with getting collaborators.  On Academia.edu,  you can find interesting  papers and connect with their authors, which can be a good start for the future collaboration. You can also upload your publications. Researchgate and Mendeley let you update your research publications.

Why not sharing your knowledge with others? If you are a beginning scientist, many of prospective collaborators might not even  have the opportunity to hear about you and your work. The more  your publications are cited the better rank they get.

3.     Networking and socializing

 Owing to LinkedIn you can exchange views with colleagues in the field.

Workshops and conferences are the perect ways to meet some inspiring scientists. However, the chance to meet them again, might not come fast.  Social media give you  an opportunity to  exchange views or ask for help on the particular matter.  On LinkedIn you can also make new contacts  through the registration in the group or get introduced by somebody whom you already know.

 4.     Getting the new job prospects.

When you have the proper contacts in your field and you know how to use  them on Linkedin, the chance of getting the job is much higher

Many companies, and inspiring leaders haven’t had an opportunity to hear about you and your ideas. Whether you  want to sell patent,   get job in the company, or just  make better contacts with some influential scientists, social media is the right way to go.
